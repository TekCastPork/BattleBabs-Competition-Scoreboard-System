# *BattleBabs Competition Scoreboard System Bug Reporting Form*

## Instructions
1. Tell me which program experienced the bug, the Leaderboard or Scoreboard, since this form reports for both.

2. Give me a description of what you were trying to do when the bug occurred (Eg. Changing team names). The more you can tell me the better chance I will have at replicating the bug for testing.

3. The Log file from the time where the bug occurred (These will be located in your application data folder. On windows this is located at C:/Users/{Your Username Here}/AppData/Roaming. The scoreboard logs will be in Scoreboard/Logs and the leaderboard logs will be in Leaderboard/Logs.)

4. Any additional information that you think will help.

Thank you for submitting a bug report.
