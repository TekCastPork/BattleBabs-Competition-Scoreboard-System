# *BattleBabs Competition Scoreboard System Bug Reporting Form*

## Instructions
**1.** Tell me which program experienced the bug, the Leaderboard or Scoreboard, since this form reports for both.

**2.** Give me a description on what you were trying to do when the bug occured (Eg. Changing team names). The more you can tell me the better chance I have at replicating the bug for testing.

**3.** The Log file from the time where the bug occurred (These will be located in your application data folder. On windows this is located at C:/Users/{Your Username Here}/AppData/Roaming. The scoreboard logs will be in Scoreboard/Logs and the leaderboard logs will be in Leaderboard/Logs.)

**4.** Any additional information that you think will help.

Thank you for submitting a bug report.
